## Overview
VET-IndoorDataset is an open-source dataset that complements and is similar to the ScanNet dataset. It consists of multiple scenes with the
sensor data in a .sens file, containing the RGB-D images, the camera pose information and the camera intrinsics information, all the necessary information to generate a 3D reconstruction.
We recommend the use of ScanNet [SensReader](https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet/tree/master/SensReader) to read this files. Additionally, this
dataset contains an extra scene with the different steps of the virtualization, specifically: 3D reconstruction, 3D semantic
segmentation, layout, 3D instance segmentation and CAD alignment.The dataset focuses on indoor
environments of various sizes and types, providing valuable resources for computer vision and robotics research.

This README provides an overview of the dataset and instructions for accessing it.


## Original Paper
For detailed information about the dataset and the framework presented with it, please refer to the original paper (Currently on review):
- Virtual Experience Toolkit: An End-to-End Automated 3D Scene Virtualization Framework implementing Computer Vision Techniques
